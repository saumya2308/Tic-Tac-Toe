# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It features a clean, colorful interface where two players can play against each other on a 3x3 grid. The game tracks turns, detects winning combinations, and declares a winner or a draw.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Play with a friend locally (X vs O).
- **Win Detection**: Automatically checks for winning patterns across rows, columns, and diagonals.
- **Draw Detection**: Alerts players when the game ends in a tie.
- **Responsive Design**: Clean and centered layout for a good user experience.
- **Game Controls**: "New Game" and "Reset Game" buttons to easily restart the match.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the game structure and layout.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including a vibrant color palette and flexbox layout.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic, including turn switching, win calculation, and event handling.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. The game starts with Player **O**.
4. Click on any empty box to place your mark.
5. Players take turns alternating between **O** and **X**.
6. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins!
7. If all 9 boxes are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
8. Use the **New Game** or **Reset Game** buttons to play again.
